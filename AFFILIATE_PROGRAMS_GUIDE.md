**Example Code:**
```typescript
// client/src/utils/affiliateLinks.ts
export const affiliateLinks = {
  'cerave-cleanser': 'https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0XXXXXX?tag=acnelist-20',
  'paulas-choice-bha': 'https://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=XXXXXX...',
  'differin-gel': 'https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0XXXXXX?tag=acnelist-20',
};

export function getAffiliateLink(productId: string): string {
  return affiliateLinks[productId] || '#';
}
```
